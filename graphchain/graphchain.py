"""
Graphchain is a `hash-chain` optimizer for dask delayed execution graphs.
It employes a hashing mechanism to check wether the state associated to
a task that is to be run (i.e. its function source code, input arguments
and other input dask-related dependencies) has already been `hashed`
(and hence, an output is available) or, it is new/changed. Depending
on the current state, the current task becomes a load-from-disk operation
or an execute-and-store-to-disk one. This is done is such a manner that
the minimimum number of load/execute operations are performed, minimizing
both persistency and computational demands.

Examples:
    Applying the hash-chain based optimizer on `dask.delayed` generated
    execution graphs is straightforward, by using the
    >>> from graphchain import gcoptimize
    >>> with dask.set_options(delayed_optimize = gcoptimize):
            result = dsk.compute(...) # <-- arguments go there

    A full example can be found in `examples/example_1.py`. For more
    documentation on customizing the optimization of dask graphs,
    check the `Customizing Optimization` section from the dask
    documentation at https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/optimize.html.

    Optimizes a dask delayed execution graph by caching individual
    task outputs and by loading the outputs of or executing the minimum
    number of tasks necessary to obtain the requested output.

    Args:
        dsk (dict): Input dask graph.
        keys (list, optional): The dask graph output keys. Defaults to None.
        cachedir (str, optional): The graphchain cache directory.
            Defaults to "./__graphchain_cache__".
        no_cache_keys (list, optional): Keys for which no caching will occur;
            the keys still still contribute to the hashchain.
            Defaults to None.
        verbose (bool, optional): Verbosity option. Defaults to False.
        compression (bool, optional): Enables LZ4 compression of the
            task outputs and hash-chain. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        dict: An optimized dask graph.
